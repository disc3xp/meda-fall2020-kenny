    <p>Hello visitors, welcome to my homepage!</p><br /><br />
    <p>My name is Kenny Chen. I am a San Franciscan. I love the city with many aspects, such as temperate weather, nice parks, numerous places of interest, cultural diversity, so many different sports filled with folks, and various great job opportunities. And guess what, this is my first-ever homepage which I always wanted to have. I have spent lot of my spare time to make this homepage filled with interesting contents and feature. I try to utilize my knowledge and skills to produce my homepage. I also spend my spare time on different activities too, such as playing basketball, hiking, and gaming.</p><br /><br />

    <p>Currently, I am unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of staying home doing nothing, I would like to spend my time wisely, that is why I am taking Mission Techie Training Program at [MEDASF]. Here, I can learn lots of concepts of the I.T. industry and coding. My goal is to improve myself and obtain a stable job. I have more than 10 years of working experience, including 2 years of professional I.T. experience by worked at private companies, non-profit organization and Human Service Agency and I have obtained different sets of valuable skills. If you want to find out more information about my career, simply check out my projects page.</p><br /><br />

    <p>And again, I will keep working on my homepage, come and visit often, I give update quite often!</p>
