3 things I like: 
The first glance at the Body, it looks very clean. All the images are aligned.
In the Body, the images can flip when my mouse curse is above it, and i can see the full image!
In the footer, at the very botton left corner, there is an icon I can click, and it sends me back to the top of the page. Interesting!

3 things I dislike: 
I think the layout is too simple, just with all images in the Body. I would like it to come with some text. so I can read and interact with his website.
In the Header, the buttons for going to other webpages are too small and sometimes hard to be noticeable.
On the whole website, the fonts and colors seems hard to read for my first glance at the website.

4 things I like:
The background color in the Header is red-orange, it catches my attention.
The Body color is white, it is very simple and confortable.
There is a mix of icons, images and many texts in the body, so the visitor won't feel bored and wanted to browse me.
In the Body, I see the team members' avartars look very cartoonish and are in the format of .svg !

3 things I dislike:
The footer seems a bit too big due to the content he is providing. The spacing could be improved.
In the Body, the page contents here make the page so long, I wished there is a "magical" button I can click so that I can go to next section.
In the body, the "Leave A COMMENT" section deserves its own space, instead of it got squished in the bottom right corner.

4 things I like: 
In the header, it gives the link of Contact-webpage, but also providing the contact# in the same font. It allows visitors to make a call right away!
Between the Header and Body, I thought it is .gif with an owl moving, but actually it is a video after I inspected! It catches my attention much and makes me to stare and stay on the website more.
The Footer gives the link to his social media, such facebook, tweeter, very easy to access.
In the Body, there is the "NEWSLETTER SIGN UP" section before the Footer, it is very useful and smart here.

3 thinkgs I dislike:
The fonts used in the body is way too big, they just take up space of the webpage.
The images in the body are too huge to me as well, maybe making the thumnail smalller.
The author maybe should enlarge his Logo a bit larger since the fonts and images he used are relatively huge.
