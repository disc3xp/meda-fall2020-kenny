Hi Ed,
I don't know why the Images 4,5, 6 are not in same line as Images 1,2,3 appear.
Is it because of I am using <figure> element this time?

I don't really know how a normal Appendix should go.

And please comment me on things I should change/improve.


(And I will fix my sentences and replace the first 3 images with my own images about playing basketball.)
Thank you and I enjoy your class!
--Kenny
