    The book does not tell readers much about the early life story of Billy Tully and her first wife.  His wife left him because she noticed that he starts to lose his reflexes and lose fights.  However, at least we know Tully loves his wife very much.  “Without her he could not get up in the morning...now he brought an occasional woman to his room, but none of them could give him anything of his wife, and so he resented them all” <a href="https://book-page12.com">(12)</a>.  After the desertion of his wife, he has to live by himself with loneliness.  However, he always wants to be with his wife and wants to get her back.

    Billy Tully is out of shape now.  He does not keep training partly because he is discouraged by his defeat to another lightweight fighter in Panama and partly because his wife has left him.  With this depression, he quit training for a while and worked as a fly cook.  There is a time he and another man got into an argument and went into a fight.  With one punch, Tully finished him.  His notices that he still has the strength of his hands and body, he has the idea of returning to the ring.  He does not want to keep working as a fly cook for his whole life, he wants to be a boxer again.  He believes that wining fights can help him get back his wife.

    Later on, Tully lost the cook job and finds another job. He works as a fruit picker on farm and gets low pay.  Meanwhile, he has a brief affair with a drunken barfly, Oma, and moves in with her.  At the same time, Tully actually returns back to boxing and trains hard to prepare a fight with a moderately well-known Mexican fighter named Arcadio Lucero.  Oma betrays Tully; she often hangs out with another man named Earl, and eventually she has left Tully.  With the desertion of his wife and his girlfriend, he feels so depressed and disappointed.  Maybe the two women Tully loves do not know all he wants to do is to keep boxing as his career and earn much money from winning boxing matches to have provide them all better life conditions.
